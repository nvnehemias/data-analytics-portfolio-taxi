# NYC Yellow Taxi Analysis 🚕  

This project explores NYC Yellow Taxi trip data to uncover demand patterns, pricing insights, and geospatial trends.  

## 🔑 Objectives  
- Demonstrate data cleaning on messy, real-world datasets  
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) with clear business questions  
- Visualize trip patterns across time, location, and fare  
- Package results in a professional portfolio-ready format  

## 📂 Project Structure  
- `data/` → raw and cleaned datasets  
- `notebooks/` → Jupyter notebooks for EDA and visualization  
- `scripts/` → reusable Python scripts (optional)  
- `images/` → charts for documentation  

## 🛠️ Tools Used  
- Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn)  
- Jupyter Lab  
- Git & GitHub  

## 📊 Example Visualization  
*(Will be added later once analysis is complete)*  

## 🚀 Next Steps  
- Feature engineering (rush hour flags, speed calculation)  
- Predictive modeling (trip duration/fare)  
- Interactive dashboard with Streamlit
